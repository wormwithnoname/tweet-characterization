# tweet-characterization

This repository is for my thesis project on the characterization of canceling tweets on twitter. 

There are 7 features that were extracted from tweet data. These are: absence/presence of emojis, retweets, time spikes, most common words, tf-idf, sentiment analysis, emotion detection. The script for this is named data_cleaning_script.ipynb

The script includes preprocessing that was from this repository https://gist.github.com/MrEliptik/b3f16179aa2f530781ef8ca9a16499af which was modified to suit my use cases. The normalizer script is under normalizer.py
